1. Origin of the dataset:
	 - The German credit dataset from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Statlog+(German+Credit+Data).

3. How this dataset differs from its origin:
	 - The original dataset is a classification dataset that contains attributes whose
		 domains consist of integers.
		 These attributes are discretized so that every attribute has at most 4 values.
		 Variables are down to 10, A1 through A10.
		 We assume label "1" (good) is preferred to label "2" (bad) to generate examples.
	 - The data overview file is added.
	 - The domain description file is added.
	 - The outcomes csv file is added.
	 - The eq_examples and strict examples csv files are added.


4. Contents:
	 - data_overview.txt: 
		 gives an overview of the dataset, i.e., the number of attributes,
		 the number of outcomes considered, the number of users from whom the data is gathered,
		 the number of strict examples for all users, and the number of equivale for all users.

	 - domain_description.txt: 
		 describes all attributes and their domains that compose the outcomes.
		 Every line describes an attribute and its domain, represented by the name of the attribute
		 followed by a list of its values separated by commas.  The attribute name and the list are
		 separated by a colon.

	 - outcomes.csv: 
		 contains all outcomes considered by the users for this experiment.
		 Every line describes an outcome, represented by an outcome ID, a list of values for all
		 attributes, separated by commas.

	 - strict_examples.csv: 
		 contains strict examples for all users.  Every line describes a
		 strict example for some user, represented by a user ID, an outcome ID and another outcome ID,
		 separated by commas.  It means that for this user, the first outcome is preferred to the second.

	 - eq_examples.csv: 
		 contains equivalent examples for all users.  Every line describes an 
		 equivalent example for some user, represented by a user ID, an outcome ID and another outcome ID,
		 separated by commas.  It means that for this user, the two outcomes are equivalent.
