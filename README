PrefLearn Library Generator
Author: Xudong Liu

1. To facilitate preference learning, we build a library of various preferential datasets useful for 
	 conducting preference learning experiments on real-world data.


2. Contents:
	 - Original/:
		 contains original datasets scraped from preference-learning.org, preflib.org, StatLog Datasets
		 and UCI Machine Learning Repository.

	 - PrefLearnLib/:
		 contains preference learning datasets translated from the original ones.
		 Note: for discretization, do NOT forgot to remove duplicate outcomes.

	 - Src/:
		 contains source codes to generate the preference learning datasets in PrefLearnLib/ from the
		 original ones in Original/.
		 Usage: ./gen /path/to/label_ranks.csv /path/to/classification_dataset.csv /path/to/strict_examples.csv /path/to/eq_examples.csv

	 - build.sh:
		 a script that automatically uses Src/gen to build the preference learning datasets in PrefLearnLib/ from the 
		 original ones in Original/.
